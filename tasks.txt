- understand how google maps works
- insert static coordinates 
- (pass from array to object)
- function creates N of people with random coordinates and name (object)
- find function that calculate the distance between two points (lat and lon) (haversine??)
- function combines every "person" of people (nested loop)
- test with 4 people

/* 
1-2
1-3
1-4
2-3
2-4
3-4
*/

- find the distance in a radius of 1km
- insert the function in the maps
- create a circle with radius 1 km to show the distance
- create a function that simulates the movement of people on the map






- npm i haversine-distance
